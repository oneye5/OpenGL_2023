An attempt at creating a rendering / game engine. I managed to get OPENGL working with textures however as well as various other systems, such as a unity style gameObject and component system. However I find myself short of time due to university and I do not plan on continuing this project due to my now better understanding of dynamic memmory allocation as well as other things that would greatly increase the quality of the end product.
